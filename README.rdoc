== Welcome to Rails

An app that will ping Heroku sites that will run on Heroku  

This app uses rvm to manage the gemset. Edit the .rvmrc file if you need to.    

To get it to run:  
Run "bundle install"  
  
Set up postgresql  
edit config/database.yml  
change all instances of "ericm" to your username  
rake db:create:all  
rake db:migrate  
rake db:test:prepare
