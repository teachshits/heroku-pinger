== Heroku Pinger

An app that will ping Heroku sites that will run on Heroku  

This app uses rvm to manage the gemset. Edit the .rvmrc file if you need to.    

To get it to run:  
Run "bundle install"  
  
Set up postgresql  
edit config/database.yml  
change all instances of "ericm" to your username  
rake db:create:all  
rake db:migrate  
rake db:test:prepare  


Also, this uses OmniAuth and Twitter for authenticaion. So you will need to register this as a Twitter app. The key and secret are in 
the file config/initializers/omniauth.rb, and you will need to save them as environmental variables:   
provider :twitter, ENV["TWITTER_KEY"], ENV["TWITTER_SECRET"]    

So you will need to set that stuff up before you actually run it.   

Right now there are a lot of comments and calls to puts, particularly in the tests. I am trying to see what the tests 
are doing. It's great that Ruby and Rails do so much out of the box, but sometimes convenience crosses the line into voodoo.   

For example, some of the tests have stuff like this: post :create, {:website => valid_attributes}, valid_session   

How do I get the object that symbol represents? At this point, I would still like to query stuff in the tests to figure out what is going on.
